/*Import scanner
Ask the user for how many days they want to measure (between 2 and 100)
	Add 1 to number when we make it a variable (might need to subtract one and then add 2)
Set up a random number variable (between 25 and 110) to 86+25
Create a loop that repeats however many times the user input variable is
Then we add all outputs together and divide by user input variable to get the average
Print each dayâ€™s high temp as a line
	For every day
Print the average temp of (user input variable) days
NEW IDEA FOR PSEUDOCODE:
Set up an array statement (Temperature at Day X: Rand)
Then create a variable for X that starts at 1 and increases +1 every time a line is printed
Replace the char at Rand with a new random number every time the line is printed
Create this all in a for loop so that it prints however many times the user asks for in the do loop
